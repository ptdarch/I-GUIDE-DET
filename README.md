# I-GUIDE-DET
The I-GUIDE Data Ethics Toolkit (I-DET) comprises four tools, developed to support reproducible and ethical geospatial data science. They are practical and lightweight, providing a structured way to document key actions and ensure alignment with open science expectations, and funder and legal requirements. All four tools work together, and each serves a distinct purpose:

1.	I-GUIDE RESEARCH PRODUCT MANAGEMENT PLAN (RPMP)
The RPMP helps researchers plan how to reach target audiences. It also helps in planning acquisition, production, and management of datasets and models. RPMP helps researchers keep track of which datasets and models are used to support different publications. It supports reproducibility and compliance with funding agencies’ data sharing and open science policies. 

2.	I-GUIDE MANAGING ETHICAL GEOSPATIAL AI AND DATA SCIENCE (MEGAID) TOOL
The MEG-AID tool is a project management tool designed to foster integration of ethical considerations into geospatial data science projects. By documenting actions at each stage of a project’s lifecycle, the tool promotes reproducibility and ethical practice. This toolkit should be used at the start of a project to anticipate ethical issues, and to plan how to address these issues. 

3.	I-GUIDE DATA CARDS
Adapted from Google’s Data Playcards (CC BY-SA 4.0), the I-GUIDE Data Cards have been simplified and tailored to geospatial research. They document the datasets used, and actions taken to address key ethical issues. 

4.	I-GUIDE MODEL CARDS
I-GUIDE Model Cards are an adaptation of the I-GUIDE Data Cards, structured to support model documentation. They capture information about a model’s architecture, purpose, data, validation, ethical issues, and interpretability. Each model used in a project should have a Model Card.

A glossary defining key terms is available, along with concise primers on the following topics:
-	EU AI Act;
-	EU General Data Protection Regulation;
-	Fair Inclusion in Geospatial Data Science;
-	Informed Consent in Geospatial Science.
